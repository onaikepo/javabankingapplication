A Simple Java Banking Application

This is a simple java banking application. 

I intend to keep on developing the application in teh future to see how I can extend the service.

As of v1.1, it still requires manual intervention to add the two key pieces of customer data (Customer Name/Customer ID), this is currently used to create a constructor. 

Users are able to do the following:
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- View Previous Transactions
- Check their balance
